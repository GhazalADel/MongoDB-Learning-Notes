    "mongoDB does not use `json` but `bson` which stands for `binary json` for storing data in database. all you will write and see will be json code but behind the scenes, mongoDB actually uses bson data. this conversion is done by the drivers and this is simply done because for one, it is more efficient to store than json data, so it's faster and more efficient and additioanally it supports additional types because for example that objectId thing we saw in the lecture is not valid normal json and there are some other types too."
